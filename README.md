# About
This is a project made to be my portfolio, here you can find more about me and look at some of my projects.
You can access the site here https://luizgustavo.netlify.app/, or here https://lg-portfolio-api.herokuapp.com. 
If you opt to use the Heroku link you will fetch the projects faster because everything is on the same server.  
  
There is an edit page that is used to create, edit or delete projects. This page is not supposed to be used by everyone. 
To access the page go to /edit.  
  
There is more information about the server and the API here https://github.com/LGPossatto/my-portfolio-server/tree/main.
